# SAR
 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) documentation and data analysis

#Why SAR?
24/7 imaging capabilities: due to weather and illumination independence
Advanced change detection performance: due to stable image geometry and own signal source
Complementary to optical sensors: provides independent information about the surface

#What is radar Aperture?
Radar Aperture is term used for antenna on spacecraft or aircraft. The radar antenna first transmits electromagnetic energy toward earth and the receives the returning energy after it reflects off objects on the planet.

#What does Synthetic Aperture means?
Generally, amount of information is positively proportional to length of antenna. However, antennas in space are not large, but spacecraft's motion is used to simulate a larger antenna along with advanced signal-processing techniques resulting in formation of Synthetic Aperture.
