## SAR- Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) documentation and data analysis

## Why SAR?
24/7 imaging capabilities: due to weather and illumination independence <br>
Advanced change detection performance: due to stable image geometry and own signal source <br>
Complementary to optical sensors: provides independent information about the surface

## What is radar Aperture?
Radar Aperture is term used for antenna on spacecraft or aircraft. The radar antenna first transmits electromagnetic energy toward earth and the receives the returning energy after it reflects off objects on the planet.

## What does Synthetic Aperture means?
Generally, amount of information is positively proportional to length of antenna. However, antennas in space are not large, but spacecraft's motion is used to simulate a larger antenna along with advanced signal-processing techniques resulting in formation of Synthetic Aperture.

## What is interferometric SAR(InSAR)?
Synthetic Aperture Radar interferometry detects motion or elevation by comparing radar signals from two or more images of the same scene. The images are taken at different times from the same vantage point in space.

## How does radar see through clouds?
Radar wavelength is longer than particles in a cloud, such as droplets, the signal traveling through cloud is mostly unaffected by any refraction at the boundaries of different media.

## Why do radar data and images often lack color?
In microwave remote sensing, scientists measure the time and magnitude of the signal backscattered from ground to the radar antenna. The magnitude of the signal defines the brightness of a given pixel in the image, which is considered as value of all three Red, Blue and Green incase of pictorial representation and can also be called grayscale.
